### Commit Messages
- Start with capital letter
- No period
- Imperative and present tense
- Descriptive of outcome
- Short (less than 72 characters)
- For working branch commits, first line is sufficient


### Pull Requests
- Update working branch and test with most recent code before PRing
- PR title should take the form of a commit message title
- Body of PR should take the form of a full commit message body
- Once approved, the PR author is responsible for squash merging into the destination branch
- Branches should be deleted after merge

### Branch Names
- Use a new branch for each new feature and eventual PR
- Use the format of "type/descriptive-outcome"
- Types include:
  - bugfix
  - feature
  - docs
  - testing
- The descriptive-outcome should describe what will be achieved by merging the branch
